      [Preview](https://rugged-mandolin.cloudvent.net/about/#:~:text=A%20demonstration%20of,Another%20new%20paragraph)
      | A demonstration of how Hugo and Rosey work in CloudCannon. This site has
      extra setup so that we can enter translations via the CloudCannon GUI.
      Additional languages can be set in the environment variables in
      CloudCannonâ€™s build configuration.


      A new test paragraph, with **some** _**markdown to put**_ the demo through
      its paces tests.  

      A line break


      Another new paragraph
